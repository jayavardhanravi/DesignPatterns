# Design Patterns using C++


[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ift8fadhnt3snpah?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jayavardhanravi/designpatterns)
![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-C++-Blue)

Collection of various design patterns with example implementation in C++. Creational, Structural and Behavioral design patterns have been implemented. This also includes some of the commonly used Idiom in C++ programming. This is just to demonstrate the usage of the design patterns. 

**Note:** Code is NOT optimized but is used as a part of knowledge sharing.

## Creational Design Patterns 

| Pattern Name | Description  |
| :---   | :--- |
| [Factory Method] | General object construction is replaced with a specific method |
| [Abstract Factory] | Group of related class without specifying concrete implementation |
| [Builder] | Stepwise construction of Complex objects|
| [Prototype] | Object constructed from a prototype|
| [Singleton] | Build Class with single instance|

## Structural Design Patterns
| Pattern Name | Description  |
| :---   | :--- |
| [Adapter] | Link Objects with incompatable interfaces/classes |
| [Bridge] | Decouples Abstraction and implementation |
| [Composition] | Build Object into tree like structures |
| [Decorator] | Adding additional Features to existing objects dynamically |
| [Facade] | For providing simple interface for complex libraries|
| [Flyweight] | Sharing the common data between multiple objects |
| [Proxy] | Controlled access to original object |

## Behavioral Design Patterns
| Pattern Name | Description  |
| :---   | :--- |
| [Chain of Responsibility] | Handle Request/Data by multiple configurable Handlers |
| [PIMPL] | Pointer to Implementation |
| [Command] | Convert Requests as Objects for Handling |
| [Iterator] | Traverse elements in collections without exposing |
| [Mediator] |  Collabration between objects via a mediator |
| [Memento] | Saving and Restoring the state of an Object |
| [Observer] | Notify Events between objects having one to many relationship |
| [State] | Alter the Objects behaviour when internal parameters change |
| [Strategy] | Run-time changing of objects inturn changing behaviour |
| [Template] | Provides Skeleton in superclass allowing some of the steps to be overriden by subclasses |
| [Visitor] | Add new operations without changing the existing code |

## How to build the project
  
### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/jayavardhanravi/DesignPatterns.git`
### Open Solution file in Visual studio
In this project I used Visual Studio 2017. Choose and build the specific design pattern either in Debug or Release
